let
=============
-Scope: Global + Block scope
-For Mutable data use let
-let is hoisted but let initialize in temporal ded zone so 
if you try to access before delcration then you wil get Refrence error
- Redecalartion is not allowed
- Reassignment is allowed

-For Immutable data use const
-const is hoisted but const initialize in temporal ded zone so 
if you try to access before delcration then you wil get Refrence error
- Redecalartion is not allowed
